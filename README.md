# Trusted-AI-Tools
Decided to start this repo because there's too much noise about which AI tools actually work and which ones are just buzzwords. Feel free to contribute if you know of any reliable tools!


Everyonhe is welcome to contribute and also submit your AI tools for free

I hope we can build a comprehensive list of AI tools that actually work. There are so many so-called AI tools out there, but the fact is, the majority don’t perform as well as claimed. So, I decided to start adding the tools that have worked for me/my friends/colleagues and share the list here. If you’d like to join this journey, feel free to drop me a note with the AI tools you love and why you think they deliver as promised. :)

### My favorite and famous AI tool for  brainstorming and asking AI to add the finishing touches:
- [Notion AI](https://www.notion.com/)


### Content creation pack for beginners:
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): Ideal for creating images and carousels. 
- [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com): Great for recording tutorial sessions, editing videos, and adding effects.
- [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/apps/contentshake/) Not free but it's perfect for writing articles (focus only on the text and ignore the AI-generated images).


### Content creations using ChatGPT vs Claude:

- [OpenAI API Models](https://openai.com/api/) - I beleive living without GPT-4o is not possible anymore. It helps a lot with analyzing and doing compelx tasks. o1 is so expensive and I didn't have  atask which needs o1 actually.
- [Claude 3](https://claude.ai/) - I stopped using it after October 2024. I found Claude to be good at starting a task from scratch, but I didn’t find it as powerful as GPTs when it comes to analyzing or optimizing information. However, its writing style was much more similar to a human. Depending on your use case, you'd deciede to use Claude or GPTs. 


### AI Search engines:

- [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) - You can see more repliable searchy results instead of just sponsored ones you gert from traditional search engi8nes.
- [ChatGPT search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/) - Good onhe but Perplexity is still more advanced to me.
