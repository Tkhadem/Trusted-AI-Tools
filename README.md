# Trusted-AI-Tools

I decided to start this repository because thereâ€™s too much noise about AI tools, and no one seems to know which ones actually work and which are just buzzwords. I hope we can build a comprehensive list of AI tools that actually work.

#### Everyone is welcome to contribute and submit your AI tools for free.
All you need to do is add a brief explanation about why and how the tool worked or helped you

### Content creation pack for beginners:
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): Ideal for creating images and carousels. I love that they integrated their tool with LottieFiles.
- [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com): Great for recording tutorial sessions, editing videos, and adding effects/musics. I'm using thier $15 plan.
- [ContentShake](https://www.semrush.com/apps/contentshake/)  Not free, but perfect for writing articles (use only on the text and ignore the AI-generated images as they're totally irrelavnet). I used their $100 plan for two months. It was expensive for me, but if you can afford it, give it a shot.


### My favorite and famous AI tool for brainstorming and asking AI to add the finishing touches:
- [Notion AI](https://www.notion.com/)


### Content creations using OpenAI vs Claude:
- [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/):  believe living without GPT-4 is not possible anymore. It helps a lot with analyzing and completing complex tasks. O1 is  expensive, and I didn't need it for any of my tasks so far.
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/): I stopped using it after October 2024. I found Claude to be good for starting tasks from scratch, but I didnâ€™t find it as powerful as GPTs when it comes to analyzing or optimizing information. However, its writing style is much more human-like. Depending on your use case, you can decide between Claude and OpenAI models.


### AI Search engines:
- [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/): More reliable search results instead of the sponsored ones you often see with traditional search engines.
- [ChatGPT search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/): Good onhe but Perplexity is still more advanced to me. I think GPT search is trained on Bingâ€™s data, which doesnâ€™t seem like the best ideaâ€”how many people have actually used Bing in the past few years? Iâ€™m not sure how relevant the ranking is, as the results are sometimes off.


### Sales
- [Apollo.io](https://www.apollo.io/pricing): An affordable end-to-end sales solution powered by AI. You can get it for $49, which is much less than the $120 LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and it offers more useful functions. Sales Navigator helped me find leads, but the LinkedIn AI features werenâ€™t very helpful. I canceled my LinkedIn Premium subscription after the free trial. (If your friend has Sales Navigator, they can gift you two months of its subscription for free).

### Career
- [Seekario.ai](https://seekario.ai): Used their role assessment, resume tailoring, and interview prep with their $20 plan. I tried different tools, but this one was the most advanced, and the results were well-written and human-like. One of their cool featureis is the KSC letter, which explains how you meet the most important requirements of the job. Havenâ€™t seen this feature on other platforms.

  
### Video
- [Runway](https://runwayml.com/): Loved their animation creator! It helped me add cute, small animals to my content, making it more engaging. It's popular, I don't think you need my explanation for this one!


### Images
- [Ideogram](https://ideogram.ai): Optimizes your prompts for image creation. Has a free version, but keep in mind that others can see the images you generate. I used the free version, and the cool thing is that it shows you the prompts, so, you to learn a bit about prompt engineering and how to write a beeter prompt too!


### Meetings
- [Grain](https://grain.com/): For just $15/month, you get a virtual assistant for your meetings. You can integrate it with Zapier to keep insights and summaries of your calls with leads in one place for a small cost.
